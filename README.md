# EDA_Loan_Prediction

Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is part of an AI & ML Internship, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Loan Prediction Dataset. The objective was to understand the data using summary statistics and a variety of visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and pairplots. Both univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to explore patterns, outliers, feature distributions, and relationships with the target variable Loan_Status. The analysis also included skewness detection and multicollinearity checks to assess data quality. All insights were derived using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
